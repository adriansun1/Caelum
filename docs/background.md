# How Sports Betting Works

Betting on the outcomes of sporting events is a massive industry with mainstream audiences. However, this industry is plagued by high bookie fees. A blockchain application would be ideally poised to disrupt the sports betting industry, while bringing in mainstream audiences to the ecosystem. This document provides a summary of the traditional sports betting industry to uncover some of the jargon.

## Moneyline, Spreads, and Odds

When two unbalanced teams face off, bookies seek to attract equal money on both sides to maximize their profits, no matter the outcome of the event. Often, teams are unbalanced in terms of stengths, weaknesses, and the likelyhood of winning an event. Therefore, bettors for the underdog need to be inticed with favorable betting terms to back these teams.

### Moneyline Wager

Betting "on the moneyline" only considers the win/loss outcome of an event, without regard to the point spread.

Moneyline odds are reported to show the amount won compared to the wager. Underdog odds of `+130` to favorite of `-150` means that underdog bettors risk $100 and win $130 if the underdog wins. Favorite bettors risk $150 and can win $100.

Team     | Moneyline | Notes               |
-------- | --------- | ------------------- |
Favorite | -150      | Risk $150, win $100 |
Underdog | +130      | Risk $100, win $130 |

The difference in moneyline odds goes to the bookie.

### Point Spread 

A `point spread` is set by odds makers based on the precied strengths and weaknesses of each team. The favorite may have a spread of `-3.7` and the underdog is equal and opposite at `+3.7`. The favorite always has a negative spread. This handicap is subtracted from the final score of the favorite team. Parties backing the favorite are betting that this team will win by at least 4 points.

Example outcomes of spead bets: 

| FAV Pts | UND Pts | Game Outcome  | Spread Outcome  |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 21      | 13      | FAV wins      | FAV backers win |
| 21      | 20      | FAV wins      | UND backers win |
| 21      | 24      | UND wins      | UND backers win |

A `push` occurs when teams "tie" in terms of the spread. This can only happen if the spread is set as an integer (and half points do not exist in the game). In the event of a push, both parties get their money back.

### Odds 

`Odds` for point spread bets are reported with bookie fees ("juice") included. Odds of `-110` mean that a $110 wager wins $100 (plus the original wager) if the backed team coveres the spread. Money from the losing side of the bet covers the winners payouts, and supplies the bookie with a 10% commission.

### Line Moves

Odds makers may change odds prior to an event due to weather, injuries, or other circumstances. It also may be an adjustment due to betting markets favoring one team over another. These moves may ultimately refelct advantages or disadvantages to each of the betting parties, as previous bets are still evaluated at the spread that they were placed.

### Partial Game Betting

It is common to bet on parts of a game, such as a half or a quarter. Sportsbooks set odds and spreads for each interval.
